## What?

A semi-organized group tour of Montreal and a delicious and authentic meal at a Quebec Sugar Shack ("cabane à sucre")!

(What's a Sugar Shack? Here are a few articles: [this](https://www.quebec-cite.com/en/restaurants-quebec-city/sugar-shacks), [this](https://www.mtl.org/en/experience/sugar-shack-101), [this](https://urbanguidequebec.com/cabanes-a-sucre-a-guide-to-quebec-sugar-shacks/), and [this](https://www.jumpstreet.com/blog/traditional-french-canadian-sugar-shack-meal))

## When?

Friday **March 21st** to Monday **March 24th** inclusive, in the year of 2025!

## How much?

- train tickets are $150 round trip right now NYC ↔ Montreal!! **DON'T WAIT, BUY THEM EARLY!! (see below)**
- the sugar shack meal is very roughly about $60 USD, if that
- transportation to and from the sugar shack will cost... maybe $20 per person? this will be confirmed
- you'd be spending 3 nights in Montreal - I'll try to provide some good hotel/hostel options

## Itinerary from New York City

- Fri 3/21: New York → Montreal by train
- Sat 3/22: Sugar shack day!
- Sun 3/23: Montreal activities (art, food, shopping, leisure) - suggestions/a map will be provided!

## I want this! aka How To Book

This is a "semi-"organized tour, meaning that:

1. **YOU** need to book the roundtrip NYC ↔ Montreal [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/home.html) tickets yourself (you can do it! **DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THOUGH**)
   - I recommend getting the "Flex" ticket option which is fully refundable
2. **YOU** need to book your hotel/hostel for the 3 nights (same, do it soon!)
3. Please let <a href="mailto:hi@greg.technology">Greg (me)</a> know that you're coming - a screenshot of your Amtrak tickets helps confirm this! :-) Once I know you're coming, I will modify the sugar shack reservation to include you.
4. The idea is that you can mostly be on your own if you want to: you can fly to Montreal instead of taking the train, you can join other people on Sunday for leisurely Montreal activities or not, it's all good. But if you want to join everyone else, we'll try to do things as a group as well!

## FAQ
