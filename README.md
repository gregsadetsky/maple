![cabane](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ed7915-4844-4c12-8bfe-c6aa3fefdb03)

## What?

A semi-organized group tour of Montreal and a very delicious meal at an authentic Quebec Sugar Shack ("cabane à sucre")!

## When?

Friday **March 21st** to Monday **March 24th** inclusive, in the year of 2025!

## How much?

- train tickets are $150 round trip right now NYC↔Montreal!! **DON'T WAIT, BUY THEM EARLY!!**
- the sugar shack meal is very roughly about $60 USD, if that
- transportation to and from the sugar shack will cost... maybe $20 per person? this will be confirmed soon
- you'd be spending 3 nights in Montreal - I'll try to provide some good hotel/hostel options

## Itinerary from New York City

- Fri 3/21: New York -> Montreal by train ([Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/home.html))
- Sat 3/22: Transportation (bus? van? TBD) to "[Au Sentier de l'Érable](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6ejXwmCBAzsTNUN79)" Sugar Shack
- Sun 3/23: Montreal activities (art, food, shopping, leisure) - suggestions/a map will be provided!
- Mon 3/24: Montreal -> New York by train (Amtrak)

## I want this!

This is a "semi-"organized tour, meaning that:

1. YOU need to book the roundtrip NYC<->Montreal Amtrak tickets yourself (you can do it! **DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE**)
2. YOU need to book your hotel/hostel for the 3 nights (same, do it soon!)
3. Please let <a href="mailto:hi@greg.technology">Greg (me)</a> know that you're coming - a screenshot of your Amtrak tickets helps to confirm this! :-) Once I know you're coming, I will modify the sugar shack reservation to include you.
4. The idea is that you can mostly be on your own if you want to: you can fly to Montreal instead of taking the train, you can join other people on Sunday for leisurely Montreal activities or not, it's all good. But if you want to join everyone else, we'll try to do things as a group as well!
