![cabane](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ed7915-4844-4c12-8bfe-c6aa3fefdb03)

## What?

A semi-organized group tour of Montreal and a delicious and authentic meal at a Quebec Sugar Shack ("cabane à sucre")!

(What's a Sugar Shack? Here are a few articles: [this](https://www.quebec-cite.com/en/restaurants-quebec-city/sugar-shacks), [this](https://www.mtl.org/en/experience/sugar-shack-101), [this](https://urbanguidequebec.com/cabanes-a-sucre-a-guide-to-quebec-sugar-shacks/), and [this](https://www.jumpstreet.com/blog/traditional-french-canadian-sugar-shack-meal))

## When?

Friday **March 21st** to Monday **March 24th** inclusive, in the year of 2025!

## How much?

- train tickets are ~~$150~~ $157 (it's going up!) round trip right now NYC ↔ Montreal!! **DON'T WAIT, BUY THEM EARLY!! (see below)**
- the sugar shack meal is very roughly about $60 USD, if that
- transportation to and from the sugar shack will cost... maybe $20 per person? this will be confirmed
- you'd be spending 3 nights in Montreal - I'll try to provide some good hotel/hostel options

## Itinerary from New York City

- Fri 3/21: New York → Montreal by train
- Sat 3/22: Sugar shack day!
- Sun 3/23: Montreal activities (art, food, shopping, leisure) - suggestions/a map will be provided!
- Mon 3/24: Montreal → New York by train

## I want this! aka How To Book

This is a "semi-"organized tour, meaning that:

1. **YOU** need to book the roundtrip NYC ↔ Montreal [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/home.html) tickets yourself (you can do it! **DO IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THOUGH**)
   - I recommend getting the "Flex" ticket option which is fully refundable
2. **YOU** need to book your hotel/hostel for the 3 nights (same, do it soon!)
   - airbnb is an option, obviously
   - you can also find a hostel: you usually have a range of options from a room with shared bunk beds ("dortoir") to private rooms ("chambre privée") for 2 or 5 people. one good place is [Auberge Chez Jean](http://www.aubergechezjean.com/)
4. Please let <a href="mailto:hi@greg.technology">Greg (me)</a> know that you're coming - a screenshot of your Amtrak tickets helps confirm this! :-) Once I know you're coming, I will modify the sugar shack reservation to include you.
5. The idea is that you can mostly be on your own if you want to: you can fly to Montreal instead of taking the train, you can join other people on Sunday for leisurely Montreal activities or not, it's all good. But if you want to join everyone else, we'll try to do things as a group as well!

## FAQ

- which sugar shack will it be?
  - I will look into a few options!
- will there be a vegetarian option?
  - yes, there will be a vegetarian option!
- is there a WhatsApp group?
  - yes there is! [join here](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CeiBCn1s6h8KticJuDiXCp)
- wasn't there a super cool NYC-Montreal train demoparty a few years ago?
  - yeah no totally - [Synchrony](https://nickm.com/synchrony/)!! it's extremely cool but I don't know if I can manage to do something as cool. but it's very cool/tempting. like on one hand should we bring our laptops (it is a ~10 hour ride both ways)? on the other hand, what if we didn't bring our laptops? would it be more relaxing? would it be more relaxing to code for 10 hours? but it would be fun, since we're all going as a group...... I don't know! let's think about it.
- hey greg, it's your faq, you do whatever you want - do you want to share some Quebec music?
  - heck yeah! [this](https://maremusique.bandcamp.com/album/jean-paul-guimond-fournisseur-officiel) album from 
Jean​-​Paul Guimond is full of extremely beautiful traditional Quebec singing. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Svjcda-84) is a super duper well known traditional song (it's so good). finally, [my friends](https://zephyrartillerie.bandcamp.com/album/chicago) recorded an album ~16 years ago and it's still so great. give it a listen. ok ok one last thing... [this](https://tirgroupe.bandcamp.com/track/thermoplastique) is one of my favorite punkish-hard-rock songs. that's it!
- but I don't speak French!
  - you'll be fine! just remember "[bonjour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vukVrC09TKk)" means hi, and you can even say it as goodbye, and "[merci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcAJOSeg1jE)" means thanks. also "[oui](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Uj15M0o2A)" (yes) and "[non](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUCoDInBP9M)" (no) and you should be good! oh also "[s'il vous plaît](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZE5uZ5uMJ8)" (please). you're good!
